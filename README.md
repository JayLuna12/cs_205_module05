This repository serves as an illustrative guide for the process of forking a repository on GitHub.

Forking a repository involves creating a personalized duplicate of someone else's project. These forks serve as a crucial link between the original repository and your individual copy. They empower you to contribute to the improvement of others' projects by proposing your modifications to the original project through Pull Requests. Forking lies at the heart of collaborative coding on GitHub.
